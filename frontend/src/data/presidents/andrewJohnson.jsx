    content: `General Grant,
I surrender this office to you as I have surrendered so much else these four years past—with reluctance, yet with the knowledge that I have done my duty as conscience dictated, however unpopular that duty proved.

You inherit a nation nominally reunited but still torn by passion and revenge. I have endeavored to heal the wounds of war through a policy of mercy toward our Southern brethren, yet Congress has thwarted me at every turn, preferring punishment to reconciliation. The Radical Republicans speak of justice while practicing tyranny, imposing military rule upon states whose only crime was seeking to resume their place in our federal system.

My greatest regret is that I could not complete Lincoln's work of restoration. His plan of mercy has been perverted into a scheme of vengeance. I opposed the Fourteenth Amendment not from hatred of the Negro, but from conviction that forced constitutional change violates the very principles we fought to preserve. States coerced into ratification make a mockery of federal union.

You will face the same congressional cabal that has tormented my administration. They speak of protecting the freedman while caring nothing for constitutional government. Their Reconstruction Acts have made a wasteland of the South and elevated the ignorant over the intelligent. Beware their false promises of progress—they seek only power and the spoils of office.

I have been vilified as no president before me, impeached for defending executive prerogatives that every president since Washington has exercised. Though the Senate acquitted me by a single vote, my reputation lies in ruins. Yet I regret nothing, for I have upheld my oath to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution as written, not as politicians would remake it.

Remember that you are President of all the people, not merely the victors in our late struggle. The South must be restored, not subjugated, if we are to have true union again.

Your predecessor in trial,
Andrew Johnson`

  historicalAnalysis: `Andrew Johnson's presidency represents one of the most turbulent and controversial periods in American history. Thrust into office by Lincoln's assassination, Johnson's fundamental disagreements with Congress over Reconstruction policy led to constitutional crisis and his impeachment.

[SECTION]Background and Unexpected Succession

Johnson came to the presidency with a unique background among American presidents. Born in poverty in North Carolina, he was apprenticed to a tailor and largely self-educated. Moving to Tennessee, he built a political career based on advocacy for poor whites against the planter aristocracy.

Despite being a Southern Democrat, Johnson remained loyal to the Union during the Civil War, serving as military governor of occupied Tennessee. Lincoln chose him as running mate in 1864 to symbolize national unity and appeal to War Democrats. Johnson's drunken performance at his vice-presidential inauguration, however, raised questions about his fitness for office.

Lincoln's assassination on April 14, 1865, elevated Johnson to the presidency at the most critical moment in American history. Unlike Lincoln, who had grown more supportive of Black rights, Johnson remained committed to white supremacy and limited federal intervention in state affairs.

[SECTION]Reconstruction Policy and Congressional Conflict

Johnson's approach to Reconstruction reflected his constitutional philosophy and racial views. His plan, announced while Congress was in recess, was remarkably lenient: former Confederate states needed only to ratify the Thirteenth Amendment, repudiate Confederate debt, and nullify secession ordinances.

This policy allowed former Confederate leaders to regain power quickly. Southern states elected Confederate generals and politicians to Congress and passed "Black Codes" that severely restricted African American freedom. These developments outraged Northern Republicans who had expected more fundamental change.

When Congress reconvened in December 1865, Republicans refused to seat Southern representatives and began crafting their own Reconstruction program. The resulting conflict between Johnson and Congress dominated his presidency and fundamentally altered the balance of power between executive and legislative branches.

[SECTION]Civil Rights Legislation and Vetoes

Johnson's opposition to civil rights legislation created irreconcilable conflict with Congress. He vetoed the Freedmen's Bureau Bill and the Civil Rights Act of 1866, arguing they exceeded federal constitutional authority and discriminated against whites.

Congress overrode both vetoes, marking the first time in American history that major legislation became law over presidential opposition. These overrides demonstrated Republican unity and Johnson's political isolation, even within his adopted Republican Party.

The Fourteenth Amendment, passed by Congress in 1866, represented the most significant constitutional change since the Bill of Rights. Johnson opposed the amendment and encouraged Southern states to reject it, further alienating moderate Republicans who might have supported him.

[SECTION]Impeachment Crisis

The impeachment crisis began with passage of the Tenure of Office Act in 1867, which prohibited the president from removing certain officials without Senate consent. Republicans designed the law to protect Radical Republicans in Johnson's cabinet, particularly Secretary of War Edwin Stanton.

When Johnson dismissed Stanton in February 1868, the House voted to impeach him for "high crimes and misdemeanors." The eleven articles of impeachment focused primarily on the Tenure of Office Act violation, though they also included broader charges of attempting to obstruct Reconstruction.

The Senate trial lasted from March to May 1868, with Chief Justice Salmon P. Chase presiding. Johnson's conviction required a two-thirds majority, but the Senate fell one vote short, with seven Republicans joining Democrats to acquit. The narrow acquittal preserved the presidency's independence but left Johnson politically destroyed.

[SECTION]Economic and Foreign Policy

Despite Reconstruction controversies, Johnson achieved several significant accomplishments in other areas. The purchase of Alaska from Russia in 1867 for $7.2 million, negotiated by Secretary of State William Seward, was initially derided as "Seward's Folly" but proved strategically valuable.

The administration also addressed post-war economic challenges, including massive federal debt and the transition from wartime to peacetime economy. Johnson generally supported conservative fiscal policies and opposed federal spending on internal improvements.

Internationally, Johnson's administration dealt with French intervention in Mexico, successfully pressuring Napoleon III to withdraw French troops and end the Maximilian regime. This assertion of the Monroe Doctrine helped restore American prestige after the Civil War.

[SECTION]Reconstruction Acts and Military Rule

Congressional Republicans, frustrated with Johnson's obstruction, passed a series of Reconstruction Acts beginning in 1867. These laws divided the South into military districts under federal control and required new state constitutions guaranteeing Black suffrage.

Johnson vetoed each Reconstruction Act, but Congress consistently overrode his vetoes. The president then attempted to limit enforcement through his control of military commanders, leading to further conflict with Congress and contributing to impeachment charges.

The military Reconstruction program succeeded in registering Black voters and enabling Republican governments in Southern states, but it also created lasting resentment among white Southerners that would influence post-Reconstruction politics.

[SECTION]Political Isolation and Legacy

By 1868, Johnson had become politically isolated, rejected by both parties and most of the press. Republicans viewed him as an obstacle to civil rights progress, while Democrats distanced themselves from his controversial presidency.

Johnson sought the Democratic nomination in 1868 but received little support. After leaving office, he attempted a political comeback, eventually returning to the Senate in 1875 shortly before his death. His brief Senate service provided some vindication, but his presidential reputation remained damaged.

[SECTION]Historical Assessment
  
Historical evaluation of Johnson has been consistently negative, with most surveys ranking him among the worst presidents. His opposition to civil rights, conflict with Congress, and impeachment have overshadowed any accomplishments.

Recent scholarship has emphasized how Johnson's racial views and constitutional philosophy made him fundamentally unsuited for Reconstruction's challenges. His inability to adapt to changing circumstances and work with Congress proved catastrophic for both his presidency and the nation.

Some historians argue that Johnson's defense of executive prerogatives and states' rights reflected legitimate constitutional concerns, but most conclude that his obstruction of civil rights progress was both morally wrong and politically disastrous.

The Johnson presidency demonstrated the importance of presidential leadership during national crises and the consequences of fundamental disagreement between executive and legislative branches on critical issues.`,
