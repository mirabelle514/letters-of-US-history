    content: `My Dear General Harrison,
How strange the workings of political fortune! You, whom I defeated in electoral votes if not in popular affection four years past, now assume the burden I gladly surrender. Perhaps the people were wiser than I knew—they certainly showed better timing in their choice of when to seek the presidency.

I leave you a nation scarred by economic calamity that no amount of political alchemy could heal. The Panic of 1837 struck barely two months into my term, and though my enemies blame Democratic policies, the roots lay deeper—in the very speculation and expansion that made America prosperous. The monster Bank that Jackson slew was indeed corrupt, but its absence left us vulnerable to the whims of state banks and foreign creditors.

My Independent Treasury system, hard-fought through Congress, represents my attempt to free the federal government from dependence on private banking interests. Critics call it cold and heartless in the face of suffering, but I believe government funds belong in government vaults, not risking the people's money in speculative ventures. Time will judge whether this principle survives your administration.

I confess my greatest regret: that political necessity forced me to continue Jackson's Indian removal policies. The Cherokee removal in 1838 weighs heavily on my conscience, yet to reverse course would have split our party and the Union itself. Sometimes statecraft demands we choose between evils, praying that history will understand our constraints.

You inherit also the Texas question, which I deemed too dangerous to touch. Annexation means war with Mexico and inflames the slavery issue beyond our current capacity to manage. I preferred to let sleeping dogs lie rather than risk civil war, but your Whig philosophy may counsel differently.

Politics has been my life's work—the careful building of coalitions, the patient cultivation of party discipline, the delicate balancing of sectional interests. I helped create the Democratic Party as a national institution, but I wonder if party machinery alone can hold our expanding Union together. Perhaps your military experience provides insights my political calculations lack.

Your faithful predecessor, Martin Van Buren`

  historicalAnalysis: `Martin Van Buren's presidency was dominated by the worst economic crisis in American history to that point, earning him the unfortunate distinction of being the first president to lose reelection due to economic conditions. Known as the "Little Magician" for his political skills, Van Buren found that no amount of political maneuvering could overcome the devastating effects of the Panic of 1837.

[SECTION]The Panic of 1837 and Economic Crisis

Two months into Van Buren's presidency, on May 10, 1837, important state banks in New York suddenly refused to convert paper money into gold or silver, having run out of hard currency reserves. Other financial institutions throughout the nation quickly followed suit, triggering the Panic of 1837, the worst financial crisis yet faced by the young nation.

The economic collapse had multiple causes that predated Van Buren's presidency. Historians have identified three main factors: British banks stopped pumping money into the American economy due to their own financial troubles, cutting off funds that had financed much of the nation's economic growth over the preceding two decades; President Jackson's "hard money" policies, especially the 1836 Specie Circular that required payment in gold and silver for government land sales, had drained banks of precious metals; and widespread speculation in western lands and internal improvement projects had created an unsustainable economic bubble.

The panic was followed by a five-year depression in which banks failed and unemployment reached record highs. Hundreds of banks and businesses failed, thousands lost their lands, and for about five years the United States was wracked by the worst depression thus far in its history. Many Americans went unemployed and others began to go hungry.

[SECTION]Van Buren's Response: The Independent Treasury

Van Buren responded to the crisis by following a course of action consistent with his Jacksonian belief in the limited powers of the federal government and suspicion of paper money and easy credit. He called for a special session of Congress in September 1837 to address the crisis.

The centerpiece of Van Buren's response was his proposal for an Independent Treasury system, in which the federal government would deposit its funds in a series of subtreasuries rather than in state or private banks. Van Buren and his advisers hoped that an independent treasury would stabilize the American financial system by refusing poorly managed state banks access to government funds.

Congressional resistance to the independent treasury proposal proved difficult to overcome. More conservative Democrats joined with Whigs to oppose the plan, arguing that it would further contract the money supply and worsen the depression. Not until the summer of 1840 did Congress finally pass an independent treasury bill, and by then the economy had been mired in depression for nearly four years.

Van Buren's remedy—continuing Jackson's deflationary policies—only deepened and prolonged the depression. Declaring that the panic was due to recklessness in business and overexpansion of credit, Van Buren devoted himself to maintaining the solvency of the national government rather than providing relief to suffering citizens.

[SECTION]Political Consequences and Party Divisions

The economic crisis devastated Van Buren politically and split the Democratic Party. The bitter debate over the Independent Treasury drove many more conservative Democrats into the Whig Party, undermining the coalition that Jackson had built. The Panic of 1837 loomed large over the 1838 election cycle, as carryover effects led to Whig gains in both the House and Senate.

Van Buren's political troubles were compounded by his reputation for elegant living while common citizens suffered. Representative Charles Ogle of Pennsylvania accused Van Buren of "sloth and effeminacy," charging him with dandyism in dress and aristocratic tastes. These attacks undermined Van Buren's claim to represent Jacksonian democracy and the common man.

The depression also revealed the limitations of Van Buren's political skills. While he was a master at building party organizations and managing elections, he lacked the popular appeal and forceful personality that enabled Jackson to maintain public support during crises.

[SECTION]Foreign Policy and Territorial Issues

Despite economic challenges, Van Buren generally handled foreign policy successfully. He utilized restraint and levelheaded action to resolve two potentially dangerous incidents on the Canadian border, thus avoiding confrontations with Great Britain during the rebellion in Upper Canada.

The most significant territorial issue Van Buren faced was the question of Texas annexation. After Texas won independence from Mexico in 1836, many Americans supported annexation, but Van Buren resisted these pressures. He believed that annexation would aggravate sectional antagonism between North and South over slavery and risk war with Mexico.

Van Buren announced in August 1837 that he did not support the annexation of Texas, a position that was politically unpopular but ultimately proved prophetic. His refusal to endorse annexation prevented a sectional split that would have harmed the Democratic Party and potentially led to the conflicts that eventually occurred under his successors.

[SECTION]Indian Policy and Continued Removal

Van Buren's administration continued Jackson's Indian removal policies, supervising some of the most tragic episodes in American Indian history. The federal government oversaw the removal of the Cherokee people in 1838, a forced march west to the Mississippi in which a full quarter of the Cherokee nation died.

This continuation of removal policies represented one of Van Buren's greatest moral failures. While he privately expressed sympathy for Native Americans, he believed that political necessity required maintaining Democratic unity by continuing established policies. The Trail of Tears occurred on his watch, adding to the moral stain of Indian removal.

[SECTION]The 1840 Election and Political Legacy

Van Buren's renomination by the Democratic Party in 1840 was largely uncontested, but the economic crisis made his reelection extremely difficult. The Whigs nominated William Henry Harrison, a military hero, and conducted the first modern presidential campaign, complete with slogans, songs, and mass rallies.

The Whig campaign successfully portrayed Van Buren as an aristocratic dandy out of touch with common citizens, while presenting Harrison as a man of the people despite his elite background. The "log cabin and hard cider" campaign proved devastatingly effective, and Harrison won decisively with 234 electoral votes to Van Buren's 60.

[SECTION]Post-Presidential Career and Free Soil Movement

After losing reelection, Van Buren attempted to regain the Democratic nomination in 1844, but his continued opposition to Texas annexation led southern delegations to favor James K. Polk instead. This rejection by his own party marked the end of Van Buren's mainstream political career.

In 1848, Van Buren reemerged as the Free Soil Party's presidential candidate, running on a platform opposing slavery's expansion into new territories. This campaign represented a dramatic shift for a man who had spent his career carefully avoiding the slavery issue to maintain Democratic unity.

Van Buren's Free Soil candidacy reflected his growing conviction that slavery threatened the Union and democratic government. While he won no electoral votes in 1848, his campaign helped lay the groundwork for the Republican Party and the sectional crisis of the 1850s.

[SECTION]Assessment as Party Builder and Politician

Van Buren's most lasting achievement was as a political organizer who built the Democratic Party and guided it to dominance in the Second Party System. Between 1817 and 1821, he put together a political machine beyond anything that had ever existed in the United States, and in 1827 he placed this machinery behind Andrew Jackson's candidacy.

Historians have come to regard Van Buren as integral to the development of the American political system. According to historian Robert V. Remini, "Van Buren's creative contribution to the political development of the nation was enormous... Heretofore parties were regarded as evils to be tolerated; Van Buren argued that the party system was the most sensible and intelligent way the affairs of the nation could be democratically conducted."

[SECTION]Historical Assessment

Van Buren's presidency is generally considered average at best by historians, primarily due to his ineffective response to the Panic of 1837 and his electoral defeat. However, his broader political career receives more positive assessment for his role in developing the American party system and democratic institutions.

His presidency demonstrated both the possibilities and limitations of political skill in democratic governance. While Van Buren was unquestionably one of the most skilled politicians of his era, the economic crisis proved beyond the capacity of existing governmental tools and political philosophies to address effectively.

The Panic of 1837 and Van Buren's response highlighted the tensions between limited government philosophy and public expectations for governmental action during crises. These tensions would continue to challenge American presidents and would not be fully resolved until the New Deal transformed the relationship between government and economy.`,
