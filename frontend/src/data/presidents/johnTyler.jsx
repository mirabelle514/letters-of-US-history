    content: `My Dear Polk,
How gratifying that you should succeed where I could not! Your election vindicates the principles I have championed in lonely opposition these four years. The annexation of Texas, completed in my final days, will be your inheritance and perhaps your greatest opportunity.

I leave you a presidency transformed by necessity. When Harrison died, I was forced to claim powers that were mine by right but disputed by many. I am President, not "acting president," and this precedent will serve all your successors. Never let Congress or the cabinet diminish the dignity and authority of this office.

The Whigs cast me out when I would not betray my constitutional principles. They expected a pliant tool who would sign whatever Clay and Webster placed before me. Instead, I gave them vetoes when their measures exceeded federal authority or violated states' rights. A president must serve the Constitution, not party expedience.

My vetoes of the bank bills were necessary—no federal institution should wield such power over state sovereignty. The Independent Treasury serves the nation better than any creature of moneyed interests. I pray you will maintain this separation between government funds and private speculation.

Texas was my salvation and my vindication. When both parties abandoned me, I turned to expansion as the means to build a new coalition. "Tyler and Texas!" proved prophetic, though the credit shall be yours. Mexico will test your resolve—their threats of war should not deter you from completing what Providence has ordained.

I confess my deepest regret: the alienation from my oldest friends. Being a president without a party is a lonely burden, but principle must triumph over popularity. You inherit the trust of the Democracy and the burden of their expectations. Use both wisely.

Your predecessor in principle, John Tyler`

  historicalAnalysis: `John Tyler's presidency represents one of the most unusual and politically turbulent terms in American history. Known derisively as "His Accidency," Tyler became the first vice president to assume the presidency upon a president's death, establishing crucial precedents while alienating virtually every political ally in Washington.

[SECTION]The Succession Crisis and Constitutional Precedent

Tyler's accession to the presidency following Harrison's death after just 31 days created an unprecedented constitutional crisis. The Constitution was ambiguous about whether the vice president actually became president or merely assumed presidential duties. Tyler's decisive action in claiming the full powers and title of the presidency established a precedent that would govern all future successions.

When political opponents sent correspondence to the White House addressed to the "vice president" or "acting president," Tyler had it returned unopened. His insistence on being called "President Tyler" rather than "Acting President Tyler" was crucial in establishing the principle that succession meant full presidential authority, not merely a caretaker role.

Congress ultimately confirmed Tyler's status through a joint resolution, and this precedent was followed on seven subsequent occasions before being formally codified in the Twenty-fifth Amendment in 1967. Tyler's firm stance prevented what could have been an ongoing constitutional crisis about the nature of presidential succession.

[SECTION]The Break with the Whig Party

Tyler's relationship with the Whig Party collapsed almost immediately over fundamental constitutional and policy disagreements. The Whigs expected Tyler to serve as a cooperative figure who would sign their agenda into law, particularly the rechartering of the national bank that Jackson had destroyed.

When Congress passed a bill resurrecting the Bank of the United States, Tyler vetoed it as unconstitutional, arguing that a federal government could not operate such an institution in a state that might not want it there. Congress passed another bill with modified language, but Tyler vetoed that as well. Except for Secretary of State Daniel Webster, Tyler's entire cabinet resigned in protest.

Enraged Whig leaders denounced Tyler as a traitor and expelled him from the party two days later in a declaration published in newspapers throughout the nation. This made Tyler a "president without a party," an almost impossible position in the emerging system of partisan democracy.

[SECTION]Domestic Policy Stalemate

Tyler's vetoes blocked the entire Whig domestic agenda. The party could not get their national bank, their high tariff, or their distribution bill to give proceeds from public land sales to states for internal improvements. Henry Clay proposed a constitutional amendment allowing Congress to override presidential vetoes by majority vote, but this failed to pass.

A resolution calling for Tyler's impeachment was introduced in the House of Representatives, making him the first president to face such proceedings, though the resolution was ultimately defeated. Tyler demonstrated that a president willing to exercise constitutional powers could block a congressional majority from implementing its agenda.

Despite these conflicts, Tyler did sign some legislation, including the Tariff of 1842, which provided needed revenue to a government still dealing with effects of the Panic of 1837. This pragmatic approach showed Tyler could work with Congress when measures aligned with his constitutional principles.

[SECTION]Foreign Policy Successes

Tyler achieved his greatest successes in foreign affairs, working closely with Secretary of State Daniel Webster to pursue an ambitious diplomatic agenda. The Webster-Ashburton Treaty of 1842 settled the long-standing Northeast Boundary Dispute with Britain, establishing the border between Maine and Canada.

Tyler's administration also negotiated the Treaty of Wanghia with China in 1844, opening important commercial relationships in the Pacific. He extended the Monroe Doctrine to Hawaii through what became known as the "Tyler Doctrine," warning Britain not to interfere there and beginning the process that led to eventual Hawaiian annexation.

These foreign policy achievements demonstrated Tyler's capacity for effective governance despite domestic political isolation. His emphasis on American interests in the Pacific Ocean proved prescient as the nation expanded westward.

[SECTION]Texas Annexation: Tyler's Greatest Achievement

Texas annexation became Tyler's signature achievement and his pathway to political rehabilitation. After Texas declared independence from Mexico in 1836, the question of annexation had remained contentious due to fears about war with Mexico and concerns about adding another slave state.

Tyler saw Texas annexation as his opportunity to build a new political coalition and launched his own party, the Democratic-Republicans, with "Tyler and Texas!" as their slogan. He appointed John C. Calhoun as Secretary of State to finalize annexation negotiations, though this choice inflamed anti-slavery sentiment.

When the Senate rejected Tyler's annexation treaty in June 1844, he pursued annexation through a joint resolution requiring only simple majorities in both houses. With support from President-elect Polk, Tyler secured passage of the resolution on March 1, 1845, just three days before leaving office.

Texas annexation represented Tyler's vindication of his expansion philosophy and his belief in Manifest Destiny. This achievement overshadowed his domestic policy failures and gave him a lasting place in American territorial expansion.

[SECTION]Personal Tragedies and Triumphs

Tyler's presidency was marked by personal loss and renewal. His wife Letitia died from a stroke in September 1842, making her the first First Lady to die in the White House. Tyler's grief was compounded by his political isolation and the constant attacks on his presidency.

In June 1844, Tyler married Julia Gardiner in a private ceremony in New York City, becoming the first president to wed while in office. Julia was thirty years younger than Tyler, and the marriage became the subject of intense gossip and political attacks. However, the new marriage rejuvenated Tyler's spirits during his final months in office.

[SECTION]Assessment and Legacy

Tyler's presidency has provoked highly divided responses among historians. Edward P. Crapol noted that "other biographers and historians have argued that John Tyler was a hapless and inept chief executive whose presidency was seriously flawed," while Dan Monroe observed that Tyler's presidency "is generally ranked as one of the least successful."

However, Tyler's achievements in establishing presidential succession precedent and securing Texas annexation were significant. His willingness to exercise constitutional powers despite party opposition demonstrated important principles about presidential independence and the separation of powers.

Tyler proved that a president without popular or party support could still exercise Jacksonian-style executive powers and privileges. His presidency showed both the possibilities and limitations of principled leadership in a partisan political system.

Tyler's legacy includes the crucial constitutional precedent for presidential succession, successful foreign policy initiatives, and the completion of Texas annexation that set the stage for massive territorial expansion under Polk. Despite his political isolation and contemporary criticism, Tyler's principled stands and significant achievements secure his place in presidential history.`,
